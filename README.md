## Dependencies

    Arch   : pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
    Ubuntu : apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

## Building

    git clone https://github.com/glouw/openempires
    cd openempires
    make -C src

## Running

Get a copy of Age of Empires II trial version from the internet archive:

    https://archive.org/download/AgeofEmpiresIITheAgeofKings_1020/AoE2demo.zip

Unzip, and run the installation .exe with wine. The game's asset data folder
can be found in the root directory of the game's installation:

    "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires II Trial/Data"

To play, first start the server by specifying the port and the number of users
who will be playing:

    ./openempires --path "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires II Trial/Data" --port 1234 --users 3 --server

Keep note, that three users implies two human players and one anti-cheat bot
who spectates the game and detects and restores out of syncs.

Second, start these three clients (you, on your computer, a friend on their computer,
and the anti-cheat bot on a computer you trust). The anti cheat bot must be started last.
For instance, to start one client:

    ./openempires --path "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires II Trial/Data" --port 1234 --host localhost --xres 1440 --yres 900

## Controls

Some small tweaks have been added to ease some of the controls:

    W A S D :
        Pans the camera

    Left shift + left click:
        Selects multiple of the same unit

    Left alt + Q W E R T ... Z X C V B:
        Selects a building to place, or a unit command to execute
